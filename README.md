### Description

An oscilloscope and Audio Spectrum "Viewer" with an hyper piano to help interpret the output.

I've been trying to understand the output of the Fast Fourier Transform for a proyect I'm working on

in which I plan to use the dominant frequency to associate sound with color in an analogic way (low frequency

colors with low frequency sounds, etc.)

I made this example, based on Murphy McCauley's Deeth Spectrum Analyzer v1.0 changing only the

portions of code that I needed for my purpouses. (By the way, someone uploaded the original program

some months ago, changing only the name of the author).

The program is oriented to help understand how digital audio is recorded and how you can use it for

an aplication (your own CD or MP3 player) using the FFT.

The program will graph only de peak frequency (the loudest) in each sample of 1024 (every 0.0232 sec.)

drawing lines in the position given by that frequency, using some tricks to be able to represent 22,050 positions

in a 512 width picturebox.

Hope you like the result and find the code useful.
